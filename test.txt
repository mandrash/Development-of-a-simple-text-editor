    The deadliest virus in modern %flhistory, perhaps of all time, was the 1918 Spanish Flu.
It killed about 20 to 50 million people worldwide,perhaps more.
The total death toll is unknown because medical records were not kept in many areas.
The pandemic hit during World War I and: devastated military troops.
In the United States, for instance, more servicemen were killed from the flu than from the war itself.
The Spanish flu was fatal to a higher proportion of young adults than most flu viruses.
The pandemic started mildly, in the s%fr %fcpring of 1918, but was followed by a much more severe wave in the fall of 1918.
The war likely contributed to the devastating mortality numbers, as large outbreaks occurred in military forces living in close quarters.
Poor nutrition and the unsanitary conditions of war camps had an effect.
A third wave occurred in the winter and spring of 1919, and a fourth, smaller wave occurred in a few areas in spring 1920.
Initial symptoms of the flu wer&e typical: sore throat, headache, and fever.
The flu often progressed rapidly to cause severe pneumonia and sometimes hemorrhage in the lungs and mucus membranes.
A characteristic feature of severe cases of %fb the Spanish Flu was heliotrope cyanosis,
where the patients face turned blue from lack of oxygen in the cells. Death usually followed within hours or days.
Modern medicine such as vaccines, antivirals, and antibiotics for secondary infections were not available at that time
so medical personnel couldnt do much more than try to relieve symptoms.

    Last April, John took a trip to Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a popular destination in the western portion of the United States. 
The town is most popular for its casinos, hotels, and exciting nightlife.
In downtown Las Vegas, John spent a lot of time on The Strip, which is a 2.5 mile stretch of shopping,
entertainment venues, luxury hotels, and fine dining experiences. This is probably the most commonly visited tourist area in the city.
The Strip at night looks especially beautiful. All of the buildings light up with bright, neon, eye-catching signs to attract visitor attention.
A stay in Las Vegas can feel similar to a visit to many popular cities worldwide.
Many of the hotels have miniature versions of important international sites and monuments.
These famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Venice, and even ancient Rome.
One day, John took a side trip outside of the city to visit the Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World.
John especially liked the canyon because it was removed from all of the noise and movement in downtown Las Vegas.
John had a great time during his trip to Las Vegas. He did not win a lot of money in the casinos.
However, he managed to see a lot of amazing sites during his visit to this city that never sleeps.




    In our modern world, there are many factors that place the wellbeing of the planet in jeopardy.
While some people have the opinion that environmental problems are just a natural occurrence,
others believe that human beings have a huge impact on the environment. Regardless of your viewpoint,
take into consideration the following factors that place our environment as well as the planet Earth in danger.
    Global warming or climate change is a major contributing factor to environmental damage. Because of global warming,
we have seen an increase in melting ice caps, a rise in sea levels, and the formation of new weather patterns.
These weather patterns have caused stronger storms, droughts, and flooding in places that they formerly did not occur.
Air pollution is primarily caused as a result of excessive and unregulated emissions of carbon dioxide into the air.
Pollutants mostly emerge from the burning of fossil fuels in addition to chemicals, toxic substances, and improper waste disposal.
Air pollutants are absorbed into the atmosphere, and they can cause smog, a combination of smoke and fog, in valleys as well as produce
acidic precipitation in areas far away from the pollution source.
In many areas, people and local governments do not sustainably use their natural resources.
Mining for natural gases, deforestation, and even improper use of water resources can have tremendous effects on the environment.
While these strategies often attempt to boost local economies, their effects can lead to oil spills, interrupted animal habitats, and droughts.

They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge walketh on lame feet,like spiders do they wait.
I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.
They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find them playing, that they perspired thereby.
We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice.
And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did they take a dislike to me.
They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and so they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads.
Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto been heard by the most learned.
All mankind's faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and me: they call it "false ceiling" in their houses.
But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts ABOVE their heads; and even should I walk on mine own errors, still would I be above them and their heads.
For men are NOT equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, THEY may not will! Thus spake Zarathustra.
"Since I have known the body better"said Zarathustra to one of his disciples"the spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit; and all the 'imperishable'that is also but a simile."
"So have I heard thee say once before," answered the disciple, "and then thou addedst: 'But the poets lie too much.' Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much?"
Friedrich Nietzsche Thus Spake Zarathustra OriginalBook.Ru
"Why?" said Zarathustra. "Thou askest why? I do not belong to those who may be asked after their Why."
Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced the reasons for mine opinions.
Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my reasons with me?
It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; and many a bird flieth away.
And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote, which is alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my hand upon it.
But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too much? But Zarathustra also is a poet.
Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?""
The disciple answered: "I believe in Zarathustra." But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled.
Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.
But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie too much: he was right WE do lie too much.
We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to lie.
And which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing hath there been done.
And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart with the poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!
And even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one another in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in us.
And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which CHOKETH UP for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people and in their "wisdom."
